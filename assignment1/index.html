          <b>1: Spend 2 minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail</b>
    <div class="b"><ul>
        <li>Inital view of the site, a mostly monochromatic screen with large text that read "live in a world shaped by artists"</li>
        <li>There were interesting widgets on the bottom right corner, for weather and time, which I clicked on to expand</li>
        <li>Swiped up on the main page, overwhelmed by the visual clutter so I clicked on the largest text on left screen which served as a menu</li>
        <li>Hovering the curser over certain words or icons changed the format or design of the webpage, I spend some time discovering each hidden design</li>
        <li>Browsed content in “about” and “programs” there was a lot of text, so I didn’t read it throughly</li>
        <li>I didn’t browse “news”, “contact” or “donate now” because it's not something I necessarily want to see</li>
        <li>The colour bar at the bottom of screen got my attention. I toggled between colours to change line hue</li>
        <li>Clicked on the x tab and the site became a basic html webpage with links</li>
        <li>Viewed some links which I had already visited and didn’t realise the back button was on the far top right</li>
        <li>Didn’t click on the social media buttons since i knew it would redirect me to other apps</li>
        <li>Viewed the icon next to the minimiser tab which introduced an asl video about how to use the next wave website, I thought this was strange but entertaining way to depict inclusivity</li>
        <li>Finally I viewed the chat bot feature on the bottom right of the tool bar. This makes the app feel more interactive and being able to type to an auto bot was interesting way of getting the information I want without having to sort through a dozen menu items. It made the interaction feel real, like texting a friend</li>
        <li>My first interaction with the bot was to participate in banter and mess around, soon after I asked the bot some basic questions like “what is next wave?” “When is the next festival?”</li>
        <li>However the chat bot could only answer basic questions, when I asked for futher detail into Next Wave festival I only received the same reply and link that redirected me to the ‘contact us’ slide</li>
     </ul></p></div>
    <p class="highlights"><b>2: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interating with the experience?</b></p>
    <p>The first thing that I interacted with was the tool bar on the bottom of the site. I liked the ability to toggle between different designs and formats, I found this to be the most active element of my participation</p>
    <p class="highlights"><b>3: What did you spend the most time engaging with?</b></p>
    <p>The chatbot feature kept my attention most of all. engaging in banter and having the interaction flow like a real conversation was refreshing and I enjoyed the absence of information overload I saw with other modes on New Wave site</p>
    <p class="highlights"><b>4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b></p>
    <p>The most common action was viewing different formats of the website, whether it was changing the colour format, web design, or switching to an ASL video</p>
    <p class="highlights"><b>5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b></p>   
    <p>As stated in the ASL video the web format was “created with the intention that all users are able to enjoy and navigate the page easily”</p>
    <p class="highlights"><b>6: How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</b></p>
    <p>I assume the decluttering button is to avoid sensory overload or distraction, similarly for the subtitled ASL video. The purpose of these features was simplicity and ease of access</p>
    <p class="highlights"><b>7: What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</b></p>  
    <p>I found the experience to be interesting, though overwhelming sometimes, many of the features communicated the same information so it was a bit repetitive. The constant change in colour, shape, form and either too small or too large font size interrupted the flow of the interaction considerably</p></p>

        <p class="highlights"><b>8: What metaphor or metaphors does the experiences mental model referance?</b></p>
        <p>The tool bar is definitely reminiscent of older model computers, which makes the digital experience familiar and fluid, as most people have experience with technology and have prior knowledge on the shorthand for exit and minimise button being x and -. Perhaps there is a nostalgic element, an emphasis on simplicity, or a celebration of past tech</p>
        <p class="highlights"> <b>9: What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</b></p>
        <p>When engaging with this content, I believe the intention was for users to adjust the style of the website to their liking. In doing so, the experience feels more authentic and the user is actively participating in their online interaction. Rather than passively consuming information like a book or pamphlet, the user has freedom to minimise visual noise, watch a subtitled ASL video, or talk to a chat bot if they wish. The decision of multiple methods of customising the New Wave site was deliberate and primarily served to maintain the users participation and avoid passive scrolling</p>
        <p class="highlights"><b>10: What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</b></p>
        <p>The large walls of text when I expand on menu options were jarring sometimes. I found a lot of the information to be quite boring and not something that would hold most users interest</p>
        <p class="highlights"> <b>11: What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what mkes it satisfying to you?</b> </p>
        <p>The element of activate participation was new to me. I found I had enough time in 2 minutes to browse the site contently and aquire the information I was seeking. There was enough content on the site to maintain users attention while also providing necessary information about New Wave and their programs</p>
